# ScamCanner

## Instructions for use

The project currently contains 2 directories "Surf_test" and "Testing_annotation using surf". The first one contains a python program to read images from a directory name "ImageData" inside it(Make yourself) so it will generate a csv file based on the inputs taken from the user for each image in the directory. The second one works similarly but is for classififing corners only.
